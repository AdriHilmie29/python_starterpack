Hello everyone! Hopefully you all are in good condition. 
In this repositories, I will teach the basic knowledge for using Python Language.
If you looking for Python software, you can go to this link - https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download it.
There are 4 ways to run Python program, such as Interpreter, Command, Script File and IDE.
To easier your work, you can download Python IDE by this link - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

That's all for software. Now let's move to learn things you should do before coding.
First of all, you should create a flowchart for your coding to make you understand which part that needed in your coding.
Second, create a pseudocode, which half (not much) similar to your coding, but have defined variable so it's easier for you to framework your coding.
